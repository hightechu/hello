# Hello

HighTechU is about more than just coding; it's about empowering youth with the diverse skills they need to succeed and thrive in the growing technology industry.

## About

Based in the UVic Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, HighTechU is an innovative learning community for high-school-aged youth in British Columbia to make connections, build professional skills, and explore diverse education and career pathways related to technology.

Launched in 2018 as a UVic Department of Computer Science pilot project, HighTechU has developed into an on-going collaborative initiative delivered in partnership with local industry, educational institutions and high-school students.

Diversity is a cornerstone of HighTechU. Through our learning community, we aim to create a safe and welcoming environment where all persons, regardless of race, gender identity, religion, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status, can discover and explore the world of technology and their role leading future innovation.
